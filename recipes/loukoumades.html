    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>No one will believe that you made these Greek-style donuts with only 2 ingredients! Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, these “loukoumades” are definitely a must-try!</p>

    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>400g</strong> sunflower oil</li>
        <li><strong>480g</strong> self-rising flour</li>
        <li><strong>500g</strong> orange soft drink</li>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>walnuts</li>
        <li>cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat, add the sunflower oil, and let it heat up well.</li>
        <li>Put the flour and orange soft drink into a bowl, and mix them well with a spoon until you have a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Spread some paper towels on a baking pan and place the pan next to your frying pan.</li>
        <li>Take some batter with your hand and squeeze it in your palm so that a little of the batter will come out between your thumb and index finger</li>
        <li>Dip a teaspoon in sunflower oil and use it to take the batter that comes out between your fingers, and transfer it to the pan. Each time, add 10-15 donuts to the pan as they should be cooked evenly.</li>
        <li>Fry the donuts for 2-3 minutes, until they are nicely golden, by occasionally dipping them into the oil with the back of a slotted spoon to cook them through.</li>
        <li>Use the slotted spoon to remove the donuts from the pan and transfer them to the baking pan with the paper towels.</li>
        <li>Follow the same process for the rest of the batter.</li>
        <li>Serve the Greek donuts with honey, walnuts, and cinnamon.</li>
    </ol>
